# ChatterinoLogExplorer
Quickly scan through your Chatterino logs to find what you might be looking for. 

This is an extremely quick project done just to get some very simple practice with front end work and gain more experience working with file system operations. I might polish this up eventually, but it does what I need it to do for now. 


To get this to work all you need to do is change the ROOTPATH variable inside the logs.go file, to include your username instead of USERPROFILENAME, and then you can build it or run it. 

Runs on port 9000, but can be changed in main.
